# Artano
Artano is a free market NFT marketplace built upon Cardano where people can auction, exchange and sell their art freely without any barriers to entry. Artano is for all.

Today, many NFT marketplaces (such as Superrare) are selective with who can post and mint art on their platforms. Also due to the fact many of them are powered by Ethereum's blockchain the cost of minting and transactions are significantly high. For example, Superrare's fees and commissions are high for both the collector and the artist, 15% + gas fees, and 3% + gas fees respectively. We believe this defeats the purpose of the decentralisation movement of the crypto ecosystem as a whole. It takes rather then adds to the autonomy blockchain tech is suppose to help create. Artists, collectors, creatives and tech enthusiasts should have a space to share art freely with minimal barriers to entry where they can also benefit from it financially. Artano will allow this whilst opening up creatives to using blockchain technology to sell their art thus exposing the world to the use cases of NFTs.
